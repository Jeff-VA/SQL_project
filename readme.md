### Project Title
Investigate a relational database with SQL

### Description
This project demonstrates a use case of using SQL to query a relational database and perform statistical functions that would otherwise be overwhelming and nearly impossible with a typical spreadsheet application.

Additionally, an html file showcasing visualizations of the associated four queries is included in the repository.  

In order to test the queries in the \*.sql file, a relational database management system such as "postgreSQL" should be installed.  Additionally, the sample database is not included in the repository and may be retrieved via the following link:
